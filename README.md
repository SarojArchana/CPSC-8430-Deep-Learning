# CPSC-8430-Deep-Learning
\This repository contains the source code for an assignment 1. The assignment has been divided into three parts:

Deep vs. Shallow:
Optimization:
Generalization:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
In order to run the code, you will need to have the following software installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
PyTorch

Running

Open the relevant .ipynb file for each part of the assignment.
Running the Tests
To run the tests, simply execute the cells in the .ipynb file. The code will automatically download the MNIST dataset and train the neural network models.

Built With
PyTorch - The deep learning framework used
Jupyter Notebook - The platform for developing and presenting the code
