# CPSC-8430-Deep-Learning
This repository holds the source code for Assignment 1, which is divided into three distinct parts. Each part of the assignment has been implemented in its own Jupyter Notebook and can be accessed via the links provided below.

Deep vs. Shallow:https://github.com/SarojArchana/CPSC-8430-Deep-Learning/blob/main/HW1/Archana_HW1_1_1_SimFunc1_and_MNIST.ipynb

Optimization:https://github.com/SarojArchana/CPSC-8430-Deep-Learning/blob/main/HW1/Archana_HW1_1_2_Visualize_the_Optimization_Process.ipynb

Generalization:https://github.com/SarojArchana/CPSC-8430-Deep-Learning/blob/main/HW1/Archana_HW1_1_3_Generalization.ipynb

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
In order to run the code, you will need to have the following software installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
PyTorch

Running

Open the relevant .ipynb file for each part of the assignment.
Running the Tests
To run the tests, simply execute the cells in the .ipynb file. The code will automatically download the MNIST dataset and train the neural network models.

Built With
PyTorch - The deep learning framework used
Jupyter Notebook - The platform for developing and presenting the code
